# GUI based Automation tool to extract multiple zip files from the folder
I got to work on the project that required extraction of 100's of zip files from the folder. I wrote this PYQT based automation tool to make the task easier.

### Requirements
Download the requirements from the requirements.txt file
> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage 
Run the app.py file. The GUI will appear. Just provide the folder path and the application will automatically extract all the files from the folder. 
You can download the exe file from the release.
